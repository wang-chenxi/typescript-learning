TypeScript lets you write JavaScript the same way you always do. Thatâ€™s because TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript and works with any browser, any host, and any operating system. It adds a variety of helpful tools and syntax to an already mature language, bringing the power and productivity of open-source, object-oriented development to fully compatible, core JavaScript.

In this course, Jess Chadwick teaches you how to leverage the full power of the TypeScript language in your JavaScript applications. Revisit some of the JavaScript fundamentals before turning to the data types, classes, generics, modules, and decorators that are unique to TypeScript. Get tips on defining complex types, extending and extracting metadata from existing types, and working with JavaScript modules to make your code more efficient. You can even try out your new TypeScript skills with the practice challenges along the way.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
